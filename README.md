Development Tools
Using SASS/SCSS
This project uses SASS/SCSS for styling, and it's integrated into the project through the standard Shopify theme pipeline.

Component-Based Approach
The project follows a component-based approach similar to the Shopify Dawn theme, ensuring that each section is modular and can be reused or extended as needed.

Task Runner (Gulp or Webpack)
For asset compilation and development, you can use Gulp or Webpack. If you want to set up one of these task runners, follow the instructions below for your preferred option:

Gulp Example:
Install gulp:

bash

npm install --save-dev gulp
Create a gulpfile.js for your build tasks.

Add tasks to compile SCSS to CSS and optimize images.

Webpack Example:
Install webpack:

bash

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
Configure webpack.config.js for asset bundling and optimization.

Deploying the App
Once you've set up your Shopify store and customized the theme, deploy it to production. Follow the steps in the Shopify documentation for deploying themes:
